Instructions:
1. DOWNLOAD FONT
Download and install font DIN1451.
2. WORD
In MS Word, type the names and change font to "DIN Mittelschrift Std", as large as possible. Not bold, just regular.
3. PAINT, SAVE AS PNG
Take a screenshot and paste into MS Paint. Save as PNG.
4. CONVERT TO SVG
Use a website such as Convertio.co to convert png to svg
5. TINKERCAD
Open Tinkercad, start a new design. Import the blank nameplate and place down a ruler.
a). IMPORT + RESIZE
Import your text. Resize down while holding shift, so the aspect ratio doesn't change. Reduce until the capital letter is 5mm high, lower case letter is 4mm high, and the width of the lettering is 0.6mm.
b). PLACE
Raise the text so it's 0.6mm off the bed, and center it over the blank plate.
c). HOLE + MERGE
Change text to a hole, then merge with the blank plate.
d). EXPORT
Export as a STL file.
