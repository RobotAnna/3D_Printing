Hi! You are an expert product designer, with experience in CAD tooling. I would love your help and a consultation with you. I want to learn OpenSCAD progressively, through project-based learning. My goal is to design functional household objects that can be 3D printed. I am an professional data engineer programmer with no experience in OpenSCAD, and limited experience in Tinkercad.

I want my first project to be a kitchen caddy / oil and salt organizer. Please recommend steps to take on my first project.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi! That sounds like a fantastic first project and a perfect fit for OpenSCAD, especially given your programming background. OpenSCAD is a code-first CAD tool that gives you full control over parametric design, and you're going to feel very at home with its syntax and logic as a data engineer.

Let's break this down into progressive steps so you can learn OpenSCAD through making your kitchen caddy/oil and salt organizer, while building up your skills organically.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

üîß Project: Kitchen Caddy / Oil & Salt Organizer

üéØ Goal:
Design a 3D-printable caddy that organizes:
 * 1‚Äì2 bottles of oil
 * Small containers for salt/pepper
 * Optional compartment for a small spoon or measuring items

------------------------------------------------------------

üß≠ Learning & Project Steps

‚úÖ Step 1: Install OpenSCAD & Set Up

Download and install OpenSCAD: https://openscad.org
Set up a basic project folder
Open OpenSCAD and get familiar with the UI:
 * Editor pane (code)
 * Preview pane
 * Render (F6) vs Preview (F5)

------------------------------------------------------------

‚úÖ Step 2: Basic Shape Composition (Day 1)

Learn to model primitives and combine them.

Concepts:
 * cube(), cylinder(), translate(), rotate()
 * Boolean operations: union(), difference(), intersection()

Mini-task: Make a rectangular tray.

// Tray with walls
difference() {
    cube([200, 100, 20]);  // Outer block
    translate([5, 5, 2]) cube([190, 90, 18]);  // Inner cavity
}

------------------------------------------------------------

‚úÖ Step 3: Parameterized Design (Day 2‚Äì3)

Introduce variables and reusable logic.

Concepts:
 * Variables (tray_width = 200;)
 * Modules (functions for reusable shapes)
 * Parametric thinking (change one value, whole model adjusts)

Mini-task: Make tray dimensions parameterized.

tray_width = 200;
tray_depth = 100;
tray_height = 20;
wall_thickness = 5;

module tray() {
    difference() {
        cube([tray_width, tray_depth, tray_height]);
        translate([wall_thickness, wall_thickness, 2])
            cube([tray_width - 2*wall_thickness,
                  tray_depth - 2*wall_thickness,
                  tray_height - 2]);
    }
}

tray();

------------------------------------------------------------

‚úÖ Step 4: Compartments (Day 4‚Äì5)

Now add compartments: for bottles, salt container, etc.

Concepts:
 * cylinder() for circular cutouts
 * for loops for repeated elements
 * Layout planning: spacing, clearance

Mini-task: Add 2 cylindrical cutouts for oil bottles.

bottle_radius = 20;
spacing = 10;

translate([spacing, spacing, 0])
    difference() {
        cube([60, 60, 20]);
        translate([30, 30, 0])
            cylinder(h = 20, r = bottle_radius, $fn=64);
    }

Use $fn=64 for smoother cylinder resolution.

Repeat for multiple compartments using a for loop and translate() logic.

------------------------------------------------------------

‚úÖ Step 5: Finish Design and Polish (Day 6‚Äì7)

Add fillets (via chamfers or design approximation)
Add labels (OpenSCAD‚Äôs text() + linear_extrude())
Make everything modular and clean

Bonus: Add a spoon holder

Use hull() to blend shapes if desired
